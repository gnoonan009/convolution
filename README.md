1D and 2D Image Smoothing with CUDA C/C++

1D Smoothing Program:

Smooth a 1D image by convoluting a 1D mean filter to it. Image is represented as int array of pixel values. CPU implmentation is serial code while GPU implmentation is parallel to take advantage of CUDA core performance. 

2D Smoothing Program:

Smooth a 2D image by convoluting a 2D gaussian filter to it. All other aspects are the same as the 1D program.
